Allows registered bbPress users to quickly jump to the first unread post in a topic.

== Description ==

bbPress Go To First Unread Post is a literally named plugin that allows registered users to jump to the first Reply in a Topic that they haven't viewed yet. This gives your bbPress forum the simple and expected functionality of non-WordPress counterparts like phpBB, without a lot of coding.

First, you activate the plugin on a blog that already has the bbPress plugin enabled. This is all you need to do to activate the basic functionality of the plugin, which includes:

* Automatic tracking of last reply viewed, per topic per user.
* Link next to the title of a topic if the user has unread posts (between the title and pagination)

The plugin also includes two template tags for extra functionality:

* Mark Topics as Read link
* Mark Forum as Read link

Tested for WordPress 3.6+.

== Installation ==

= Base Functionality =

1. Upload the 'bbpress-go-to-first-unread-post' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Mark Forum Read =

Users can use this link to mark every topic in a single forum as read. To include it, you simply need to add the following code somewhere in your single-forum layout:

`<?php gtf_mark_forum_read_link() ?>`

The recommended location to include it is in `content-single-forum.php`, next to the Subscribe link.

This operation may take some time, so an AJAX indicator is included along with the link. If the default AJAX indicator doesn't suit your theme, you are encouraged to replace it with your own. The plugin will look in the following places for an indicator, in this order, before falling back on the default:

1. `CHILD_THEME_DIRECTORY/images/ajax-loader.gif`
2. `CHILD_THEME_DIRECTORY/images/ajax-loader.png`
3. `PARENT_THEME_DIRECTORY/images/ajax-loader.gif`
4. `PARENT_THEME_DIRECTORY/images/ajax-loader.png`

= Mark Thread Read =

User can use this link to mark a topic as read up to the current last post, from any page. To include it, you simply need to add the following code somewhere in your single-topic layout (eg. in `loop-replies.php`):

`<?php gtf_mark_topic_read_link() ?>`

The recommended location to include it is in `loop-replies.php`, after the User Favorites link. By default it displays with a pipe character at the end, to match the separation between the User Favorites and Subscribe link.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin doesn't work! =

Check your bbPress plugin version - if you're not running the latest version, the plugin may not work, as it hasn't been tested extensively with other versions.

= How can I change the appearance or layout of the links? =

The links generated by the plugin try to match as closely as possible the Markup used by the bbPress plugin, and each offers a number of IDs and classes for which you can define your own styles.

If you need to alter the markup or content itself, the plugin also offers the hooks you'd expect on each method:

1. `gtf_get_unread_post_link` for the post link;
2. `gtf_get_mark_forum_read_link` for the mark forum read link; and
3. `gtf_get_mark_topic_read_link` for the mark topic read link.

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =

* Don't display Mark Topic Read link on subscriptions/favorites page

= 1.0 =
